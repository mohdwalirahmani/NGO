                    Aaghaaz e Taleem AeT is a non-profit organization founded in November 2017 by students of Jamia Millia Islamia University. At AeT, we are dedicated to designing interventions aimed at reducing hunger and bridging skill gaps among children in underserved communities across Delhi.

We believe in instilling morals and values that will guide them towards becoming compassionate individuals and responsible citizens of our nation. Through our efforts, we aim to equip these children with the confidence, enthusiasm, and skills necessary to make a positive impact in all aspects of society. At AeT, we live and work by the motto: EDUCATE, EMPOWER, ENLIGHTEN.

                <p>Aaghaaz-e-Taleem (AeT) is more than just an organization—it is a movement driven by the belief that every child deserves an equal opportunity to learn and grow. Established in November 2017 by a group of socially conscious students from Jamia Millia Islamia University, AeT works at the grassroots level to uplift underprivileged children in Delhi’s marginalized communities. Through structured educational programs, skill-building workshops, and nutritional support, we strive to break the cycle of poverty and ignorance that hinders the progress of countless young minds. Our approach is holistic, focusing not only on academics but also on character development, confidence-building, and emotional well-being. By fostering a supportive learning environment and encouraging curiosity, creativity, and compassion, we empower children to dream beyond their circumstances and work towards a brighter future. With the unwavering support of our volunteers, donors, and community members, AeT continues to expand its reach, ensuring that no child is deprived of education and the opportunities it brings.</p>
